# Chess

A simple Chess game made in Java with a Swing UI.

# Build and Run

Open the source code in your favourite Java IDE, it should build fine with any version of Java 1.8, but I used 1.8.0_265. You can run the chess application by running Main.class in the out/production folder.

Happy Chess-ing(?)!
